#"revised_prompt":"Create an image of a book cover for the epic 'Homer's Odyssey'. Incorporate elements of Greek mythology like a silhouette of Odysseus and his crew, confronting mythical creatures such as Cyclops and Sirens, all against a backdrop of turbulent seas and sinister cliffs. Engrave the title in ancient Greek lettering at the top, implying an ancient parchment's texture. The overall design should seem like a classical, ancient artifact. Color scheme should comprise mainly sepia tones to give it a worn, historical look."
